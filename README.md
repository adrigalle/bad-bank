# BadBank MERN Stack Application

## Description
This is a fullstack programming exercise using the full MERN stack to demonstrate a simple banking application with a front and back end.This app can create an account, login, view balance, deposit and withdraw from your balance. 

## Installation
To run this app on a local server, clone or download all of the files within this repository to your local machine. Then, run 'npm install' in the root and the client directory. Because this connects to MongoDB, you will also need an account through them and use your own MONGO_URI string, Once that is done, then 'node index.js' (from the root directory) in your terminal.

## Roadmap
This app has very basic authentication. I would love to strengthen it in the future using Firebase Authentication. I would also like to add account to account transfers, more rules for account creation (in terms of passwords), and would like the body to not look so plain on desktop. 

## License

This is an open source project, most of the code was provided by MIT Coding Program
